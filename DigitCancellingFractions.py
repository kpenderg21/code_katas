#Project Euler number 33: Digit Cancelling Fractions
#The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
#in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which
#is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
#We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5 to be trivial examples.
#There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less
#than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
#If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms,
#find the value of the denominator.
